# Compliance Declaration

## Project: Tributary

**Date:** January 2025
**Networks:** Story Protocol (Aenid Testnet), Avalanche Fuji (Testnet)

---

## Regulated Assets Disclosure

### Does this project involve regulated assets?

**Potentially Yes** - Tributary involves tokenized intellectual property royalty streams, which may constitute securities in various jurisdictions depending on structure and marketing.

### Asset Classification

| Asset | Type | Regulatory Status |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Royalty Vault Tokens | Revenue-sharing tokens | **Potentially Securities** - Fractional claims on future IP revenue may constitute investment contracts |
| IP Licenses | Usage rights | **Non-regulated** - Standard licensing agreements, not investment products |
| Bridge Tokens (Synthetic) | Wrapped representations | **Inherits classification** - Same regulatory status as underlying asset |

### Regulatory Analysis

1. **Investment Contract Considerations (Howey Test)**:
   - Investment of money: Users purchase vault tokens with cryptocurrency
   - Common enterprise: Funds pooled in royalty vaults
   - Expectation of profits: Returns from IP royalty distributions
   - Efforts of others: Depends on IP creator's continued commercialization

2. **Key Distinctions**:
   - Royalty tokens represent claims on existing revenue streams
   - More similar to revenue-based financing than traditional securities
   - IP remains owned by creator, only revenue rights are tokenized
   - No equity, voting rights, or ownership stake in underlying IP

3. **Favorable Factors**:
   - Story Protocol provides standardized IP infrastructure
   - Clear separation between IP ownership and revenue rights
   - Transparent on-chain royalty tracking
   - Creator retains full IP control

## Compliance Measures Implemented

### Platform Safeguards

1. **Story Protocol Integration**: Uses established IP infrastructure with built-in provenance tracking
2. **Transparent Revenue Flow**: All royalties tracked on-chain, verifiable by token holders
3. **Creator Verification**: IP registration requires proof of ownership
4. **Clear Token Rights**: Documentation specifies tokens represent revenue claims only, not IP ownership

### Cross-Chain Security

1. **Hyperlane ISM**: Interchain Security Module validates all cross-chain messages
2. **Warp Route Architecture**: Lock-and-mint ensures 1:1 backing of synthetic tokens
3. **Validator Set**: Multi-validator consensus for bridge security

---

## Current Deployment Status

- **Networks**: Story Aenid Testnet + Avalanche Fuji Testnet
- **Real Value**: None - testnet tokens only, no real IP or royalties
- **Production Plans**: Will require:
  - Legal review of token classification
  - IP ownership verification systems
  - Jurisdiction-specific compliance review
  - Terms of service defining token rights

## Comparison to Similar Products

| Product | Model | Regulatory Treatment |
|---------|-------|---------------------|

| Royalty Exchange | Royalty auctions | Regulated marketplace |
| Republic (music royalties) | Reg CF offerings | SEC registered |

## Intended Regulatory Approach

For production deployment, Tributary intends to:

1. **Legal Classification**: Engage counsel to determine if tokens are securities
2. **Structure Optimization**: Design token rights to minimize securities classification
3. **Creator Agreements**: Clear contracts defining revenue-sharing terms
4. **Jurisdiction Analysis**: Launch in favorable regulatory environments
5. **Compliance Integration**: Add KYC if securities classification applies

## Risk Acknowledgment

Users of this platform should understand:

1. Royalty tokens may be classified as securities in some jurisdictions
2. IP revenue is not guaranteed and depends on commercialization success
3. Cross-chain bridges carry smart contract risk
4. Tax treatment of royalty income varies by jurisdiction
5. This is experimental technology on testnet with no real value
