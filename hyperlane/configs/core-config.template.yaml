# The address that owns and manages the deployed contracts
# This account has admin privileges over the Hyperlane deployment
owner: "0xYOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS"

# Default Interchain Security Module (ISM) configuration
# For testing, use trustedRelayerIsm (simplest setup)
# For production, consider multisigIsm or aggregationIsm
defaultIsm:
  type: trustedRelayerIsm
  # The relayer address that's trusted to deliver messages
  # For testing, this can be the same as the owner
  relayer: "0xYOUR_RELAYER_ADDRESS"

# merkleTreeHook is standard for message verification
defaultHook:
  type: merkleTreeHook

# Required Hook configuration

  maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
  # Current fee in wei (0 for testing)
